* Multiple PHP versions (5.6 - 7.4, 7.3 as default for optimal compatibility)

Supported operating systems
----------------------------
* Debian 10, 9

* **NOTE:** Hestia Control Panel must be installed on top of a fresh operating system installation to ensure proper functionality.

Installing Hestia Control Panel
============================
While we have taken every effort to make the installation process and the control panel interface as friendly as possible (even for new users), it is assumed that you will have some prior knowledge and understanding in the basics how to set up a Linux server before continuing.

## Step 1: Log in
To start the installation process on your server, you will need to be logged in as **root** or a user with super-user privileges in order to continue. You can perform the installation either directly from the command line console or remotely via SSH:
```bash
ssh root@your.server
```
## Step 2: Download
Download the installation script for the latest release:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/release/install/hst-install.sh
```
If the download fails due to an SSL validation error, please be sure you've installed the ca-certificate package on your system - you can do this with the following command:
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install ca-certificates
```

## Step 3: Run
To begin the installation process, simply run the script and follow the on-screen prompts:
```bash
bash hst-install.sh
```
You will receive a welcome email at the address specified during installation (if applicable) and on-screen instructions after the installation is completed to log in and access your server.

## Custom installation:
You may specify a number of various flags during installation to only install the features in which you need. To view a list of available options, run:
```bash
bash hst-install.sh -h
```
Alternatively, @gabizz has made available a command-line script generator at https://gabizz.github.io/hestiacp-scriptline-generator/ which allows you to easily generate the installation command via GUI.
